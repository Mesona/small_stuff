This was a script I made to quickly at a summer camp I worked at.  It was loaded onto a thumb drive with a specific image on it, under a folder called Wallpaper, within which was the image.  This could probably be refined with better folder naming, less reliance on hard locations and file names, and an overall cleaner look, but meh, it does what it needed to do and I'll probably never use it again.
